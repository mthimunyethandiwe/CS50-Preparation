#implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time
# informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents,
# output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers,
# and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.
